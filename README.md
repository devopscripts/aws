aws ansible scripts
==============

This repository includes some sample codes to show how to create AWS resources, such as VPC, subnet, route table, security group, EC2, ELB, with ansible playbooks and roles.

Free feel to use these scripts to learn ansible and aws. Star and fork if you think it is helpful. Thanks.

In order to run these ansible playbooks and roles, you need to have boto/boto3 and aws cli pre-installed.
